**A simple C# solution ï»¿
**
As a license specialist I want the software to calculate the expiry day so that software is licensed appropriately. 
**Acceptance Criteria: **
- If the software is bought between 1st and 10th day then expiry date should be end of the month. 
- If the software is bought between 11th and 20th day then expiry date should be at the end of the month + 10 days.
- If the software is bought between the 21st and end of the month then the expiry date should be the last day of the next month.
